* `com/`	- communications engines (e.g., I2C, SPI, UART, etc)
* `display/`	- display drivers
* `id/`		- identification/serialization device drivers
* `input/`	- human input device drivers
* `memory/`	- memory/storage device drivers (e.g., RAM, EEPROM, Flash, etc)
* `motor/`	- motor/actuator device drivers
* `sensor/`	- sensor device drivers (e.g., IMU, light, power)
* `signal/`	- signal synthesis and acquisition (e.g., ADC, DAC, PWM, etc)
* `string/`	- string manipulation
* `time/`	- time-related device drivers (e.g., RTC)
